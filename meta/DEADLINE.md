## Part 1.1: App Description

> My app utilizes the PokeAPI (Pokemon API) and the WikipediaAPI to
> generate images based off the name of a Pokemon the user inputs.
> The user inputs a Pokemon, say Charmander, and then my app gets its
> type (fire, water, etc.) and then utilizes the WikipediaAPI to find
> an image of a location on Earth where you could find the Pokemon if
> it existed in real life.

## Part 1.2: APIs



### PokeAPI

```
https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/charmander
```

### WikipediaAPI

```
https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&prop=images&titles=lava&format=json

https://www.mediawiki.org/w/api.php?action=query&format=json&prop=imageinfo&titles=File%3A001+Volcano+eruption+of+Litli-Hr%C3%BAtur+in+Iceland+in+2023+Photo+by+Giles+Laurent.jpg&prop=imageinfo&iilimit=50&iiend=2007-12-31T23:59:59Z&iiprop=timestamp&iiprop=user&iiprop=url

```

> The first url for WikipediaAPI is for retrieving the title of the image and then
    the second url uses the title of the image to find the actual url of the image
    so it can be show in the project.

## Part 2: New

> What is something new and/or exciting that you learned from working
> on this project?

I learned a lot about APIs and how they work using the iTunes API as it was a great
    introduction. But now after looking into the APIs on the websites directly
    and sifting through all the different menus and possible responses I feel
    very competent in my knowledge of API utilization. It's a esasier
    than you would think to be able to find a specific piece of data on a website
    thats huge.

## Part 3: Retrospect

I would probably not use the WikipediaAPI as it was so difficult to start off with.
    I think now that I understand the website retrieving data from it isn't that bad
    but wrapping my head around it at first was a huge task. The PokeAPI was much more similar
    and I love Pokemon so I would definetly keep that one. It's a shame some of the better image
    websites (Imgur), are 0Auth or I would've tried to use those.
